Overview
===========

This is a Groovy language binding (glue code) for using [Pashua](http://www.bluem.net/jump/pashua) from Groovy. Pashua is a Mac OS X application for using native GUI dialog windows in various programming languages.

The only code file in this repository, `example.groovy`, contains both a generic class called `PashuaRunner` as well as  example code with uzilizes the class for displaying a dialog. The way `PashuaRunner` works is neither the best nor the only way to “talk” to Pashua from within Groovy, but rather one out of several possibe ways.

Requirements
=============
This code should run with Groovy 1.8 and Java 1.6 or later and, naturally, also requires Pashua.

Status
========
The code in this repository was distributed with Pashua versions 0.9.4.5 thru 0.9.5.1. As of August 2014, it is deprecated and no longer maintained.
